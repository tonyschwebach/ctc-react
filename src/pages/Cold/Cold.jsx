                    Our native currency COLD token is used to reward artists,
                    NFT collectors and vote towards proposals in our governance.
                    Funds raised from NFT sales are used to buy back and burn
                    COLD until the total supply is reduced to 1,618,000 over a
                    10 year period. There was no presale and liquidity was self
                    funded and locked with Unicrypt for 1 year.
